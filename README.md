This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Structure
https://course-helper-pearl.vercel.app/

In src/app folder , I have 3 folders : components , login & signup . . .

In components, I have Card and CardList javascript files that are linked to main page.js file. login and signup folders also have page.js file.
I've used material UI for interface and responsiveness , mostly Textfields ,grid2, Box and Stack layouts.For backend i've used Express.js, axios and postman 


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
